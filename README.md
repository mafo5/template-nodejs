This is my template project for a NodeJS application.
It contains:
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) (React)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)
- Jest & Hamjest
- EsLint

## Getting Started

There are several script available:
- `yarn lint` - to check code style
- `yarn test` - to run unit tests and screenshot tests
- `yarn test:watch` - to keep tests running
- `yarn dev` - to run all locally
- `yarn build` - to bundle everything into the dist folder
